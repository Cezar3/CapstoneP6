    <h1>Root Causes</h1>
    
<h3>The two root causes of child trauma are the negligence or shortcoming of parents and accidents including war.</h1>
<h4>Root cause #1 Negligence or shortcomings of parents/guardians are bound to cause child trauma but it is understated how commonly experienced this type of trauma is</h4>

<h5>25% of American children have some sort of childhood trauma that affects them later in life.
It could be overprotective or underprotective, having less material or mental wealth than necessary to adequately raise a child. Mainly it is just a parent’s inability to cope with the state of their life and a failure to take responsibility.
Rates of childhood trauma are increasing in many American states because of the residual effects of covid.
The change in daily life brought about by the Covid-19 caught parents by surprise and ruined the security of their relationship between them and their children. This kind of disruption can not be fully repaired by a return to the previous daily practices.
Anxiety- or trauma-related impairments in the integration of interoceptive and exteroceptive signals play a key role in the formation of DPD symptoms.

<h4>Root cause #2 Accidents of course can create a traumatic event in a childs life, however this trauma can permanently alter the tragectory of a child's life</h4>

<h5> Abuse, Incacerated parent, Death of a loved one, and sudden or extreme medical condition are on the list of Causes for child trauma
An immediate change or absence in a child’s life is bound to cause confusion in a child’s life.
War/Terrorism leads to masses of children bent on a radical or nonsensical ideal that leads to a ruined life.
There are immeasurable traumatic experiences caused by war and since the US has never had a war on home soil we are largely unaware of these effects. But it is simply that large groups are taught extremist views caused by one press of the button by a US pilot.
Screening children for neuroticism may help prevent pts symptoms.
